Text Alignment Network version 1, development release

http://textalign.net

This project has submodules, which must be invoked using the --recursive option:
`git clone --recursive [PATH]`

All files are subject to change. Participation in development of TAN is welcome.

New to TAN? Start with guidelines/ (see also http://textalign.net/release/TAN-2018/guidelines/xhtml/index.xhtml), 
then examples/. The subdirectory /do things provides XSLT stylesheets for creating, 
editing, and working with TAN files. The other three subdirectories -- functions/, 
schemas/, and TAN-key/ -- hold the core files needed for validation.
