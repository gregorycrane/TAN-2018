# Text Alignment Network 
http://textalign.net

Version 2018

This project has submodules, which must be invoked using the --recursive option:
`git clone --recursive [PATH]`

New to TAN? Start with `guidelines/` (see also http://textalign.net/release/TAN-2018/guidelines/xhtml/index.xhtml), 
then `examples/`. The subdirectory /do things provides XSLT stylesheets for creating, 
editing, and working with TAN files. The other three subdirectories -- `functions/`, 
`schemas/`, and `TAN-key/` -- hold the core files needed for validation.

Participation in development of TAN is welcome. If you create and maintain a TAN library, share it.
