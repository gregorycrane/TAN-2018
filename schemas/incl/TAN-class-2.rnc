    ## <tok>s that are restricted to a single token, or a portion of a single token. This is the normal behavior of <tok>. Multiple values in @src, @ref, and @pos will result in expansion across all values. But multiple values of @chars are taken to refer to the constituent parts of a single <tok> and so no expansion occurs on @chars.
    
    ## This syntax allows multiple <tok>s to be collapsed into a single one, to save space and perhaps enhance legibility. For example, a <tok> with 2 values for @src, 3 for @ref, 4 for @pos, and 5 for @chars will result in a <tok> that points to 24 tokens, each of which is filtered to the same five characters (by position, not content). Put another way, <tok src="X" ref="a" pos="1"/> and <tok src="X" ref="a" pos="2"/> is always identical to <tok src="X" ref="a" pos="1-2"/>
